This article addresses a method to create a smart contract, simulating a decentralized database
on the Blockchain network, enabling data records and consultations between public institutions
in a secure way and without the need for an intermediary agent. The method consists of
building a functional smart contract that allows the insertion of data into the blockchain, which
by characteristic is immutable, decentralized and peer-to-peer. In the Block-Office contract
prototype, we will use the remix.ethereum software, an IDE environment used by developers to
build smart contracts, where the contract coding will be done, being all the logical part of the
contract operation. The testnet network, Smart Chain - Testnet, which is Binanceâ€™s Blockchain
testing network, where the functioning, effectiveness and results of the contract built will be
tested. The Metamask which is a cryptocurrency wallet that is needed to simulate interactions
with the Blockchain through a wallet address. For this purpose, in addition to researching books
and articles on blockchain and its entire operation, a web3.0 course was carried out for the
construction and modeling of smart contracts. And all the knowledge acquired during the course
was of paramount importance, especially the disciplines with a focus on cryptography and security
programming.
Key-words: Blockchain, Smart Contract.
